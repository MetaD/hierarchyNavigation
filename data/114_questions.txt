{"rt": 289.10521507263184, "response": "To be completely honest, I found it really difficult and was burnt out by the time I got the second part. I tried to stay focused and do my best, but I don't think it helped very well. After the reference person and number appeared, I mainly just repeated it in my mind before the 4 response choices appered. Once the response choices appeared, it was incredibly quick, and I didn't feel confident in my answers."}

{"rt": 622.5231890678406, "response": "It was way too long - it was suppose to be a one hour study, ended up taking me 2 hours. Also, the keyboard buttons for let and right were fine, but the up and down buttons are very close together. During the second part, a single finger cannot be designed to each arrow button, so I had to use my middle finger to click the up or down button. This didn't make much sense, especially because the second part was when the participant had to decide very quickly. Additionally, no rest period was given. I was incredibly burnt out by the end of the whole study and just wanted it to be over already. I tried my best to stay focused and complete the experment, though I did find myself sidetracted and havin a lack of concentration. Lastly, the instruction could definitely be improved upon for the second part of the experiment. Thank you."}
