About a couple of questions into the third block, I realized I should have assigned numbers to each person and then just added or subtracted however many I was indicated to. So for most of the third block, I just remebered the number of the person I was shown, then added or subtracted depending on if it was blue, and figured out which person belonged to the corresponding number. \n\nDuring the period after th reference face an numbe appeared but befor the 4 response choices appeared, I felt like I had a mental storage of what order each person was in, and then I simply tried to find the order of the person that was first shown and then tried to find the peson corresponding to the new location."}
