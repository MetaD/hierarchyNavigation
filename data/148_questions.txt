{"rt": 398.83630108833313, "response": "I closed my eyes sometimes because it was easier to visualize the pictures and also they were tired. Aside from that brief intermission period, I used a pretty crude method to memorize their order. Originally, I figured out Mathew was first then Michael. Joseph was ahead of Nicholas and after Nicholas it was DJAC with Joshua at the very end. DJAC was Daniel, Jacob, Andrew, and Christopher. It made sense in my mind and it helped with memorizing where 5 out of 9 are relative to each other on the power scale. Then in the machine I also pictured distance and used Daniel as the halfway point on something like number line. Or anchoring at someone: if Joseph to Andrew was 4 then Jacob with a blue 3 had to be Joseph as well."}

Also, going in, I initially thought I had to tell who was more powerful based off of how they appeared in the pictures and not figure out who was more powerful through the trial-and-error idea."}
