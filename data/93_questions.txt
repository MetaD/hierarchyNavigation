So not only was I trying to figure out who was in the spot being asked about, but I was also simultaneously making note of where other people were in relation to that spot. Jacob was the first person I figured out, which might've been lucky as he ended up being the person in the middle of the hierarchy. After that I just tried to keep a running list of who was where by rehearsing the order while also answering."}
