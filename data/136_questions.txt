{"rt": 525.6660089492798, "response": "By the time I finished all the training trials I had a pretty well established \"timeline\"(?) (like an order of power) so when the person appeared, say Alex, and then blue 3, I would visualise the \"line\" of people (basically how I ordered the people in the previous exercise was what I imagined in my head) and I would count down the indicated amount of numbers, so literally my thought was \"Alex, 1, 2,\" and then instead of counting out the final number, I would think right away of what they looked like/ what colored clothes they were wearing. I usually had enough time to then think of what they were called before the 4 options showed up. This becaue based off of my own experience, I'm better with faces than with names, so thinking of the name of the person would take a fraction of a second longer, and I was always afraid of me missing the time to choose one of the 4 choices, so I would just go with what they looked like first."}

{"rt": 157.11288785934448, "response": "not at all. however I do find myself to be more patient if I know how many times the trials are going to repeat. As I remember getting kind of restless during the first training trials because it seemed to just go on forever and there was tangible indication that I was making progress once I got the order down. the trials I did in the MRI machine, however, seemed a lot more manageable because each time I finshed it was say \"now moving on to #4 out of 6 trials\" or something. Which ultimately made me keep my focus as I was \"working towards a tangible goal\" if that make sense.."}
