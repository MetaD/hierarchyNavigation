{"rt": 316.8135709762573, "response": "I have a mnemonic which is a list of all the names: Alex and Ashley MET Sarah Jessica parker eating Hotdogs (and Samantha doesn't fit into the mnemonic but I know she's at the end after Hannah). So I would see the reference person and number, then tap with my fingers forwards or backwards as I counted through my sentence. I did not tap my fingers in the MRI, but I had done it so many times before that I could just think about tapping my fingers without actually tapping them.\nOnce I had counted through my list, I would repeat the name of the desired person over and over in my head until the 4 choices appeared. I typically had forgotten who the initial reference person and number was by the time the 4 choices appeared.\nAlthough the faces of the people and the color of their clothing helped me to recognize them more quickly, my response was mostly based on the people's names."}

Another time, it flashed the 4 options so quickly that I couldn't even look at any of them.\nBut when the program was functioning normally, the task was not difficult."}
