{"rt": 517.1129720211029, "response": "In the last session (a few days ago), I learned the order of group members. I memorized them by the first initial of their first name. I knew that Michael was the most powerful. (I knew a popular kid in middle shool named Michael, so I just created tha association.) Then I memroizd the next 5: J J A C M. I asociated each lette with a finge on my left hand. Then I knew the order (not on my had, but represented linearly down \"below\" my pinky): N D. The last guy I nicknamd \"Dopey\" (his name also started with a \"J\" so this was easier; sorry if you're reading this, Joseph!). When the original image appeared, I detemined wich finger corresponded with with that person (somtimes I knew just by association (e.g. Andrew was my middle finger) & sometimes I had to cycle through in order, saying \"JJACM\" to myself as I moved my fingers. When the number appeared, I counted that many fingers away & determined which person was associated with that finger."}

Pehaps it is easiest if you *always* need to press a button. (Sorry, I can't use arrow keys to navigate this to edit.To be clear, thi appies to the first round of the study a few days ago.)\n\nToday's task was a bit harder-than-necessary because the colored buttons weren't evenly spaced: the top-bottom distance was greater than the left-right distance. This task would be easier if the buttons were a square, not a kite."}
