{"rt": 253.8144679069519, "response": "After some trial and error, I began to form the hierarchy of the faces/people in my head and assigned them a ranking. In order to help with the tasks that determined who was more powerful, I sorted the people into tiers of two. So, Emily and Taylor were the top tier and so on. Also, it helped that each person had a different colored shirt on, so it was what helped me remember who went where in the rankings. Since I had established the order of each person in my head, during the period aftr te reference face and number appeared, I would count to that person in the ranking and the tiers would help expedite the counting."}
