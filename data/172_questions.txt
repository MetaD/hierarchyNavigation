{"rt": 597.649523973465, "response": "I used different memory tricks, like whenever I was asked who was 4 below Sarah, I knew it was Samantha because their names both start with S. That would also help me to figure out Samantha's relationship to other people, like since I know Sarah is 4 above Samantha, then 3 above would be Madison, since she is 1 below Sarah. I also used Jessica as a point of reference, since she was in the middle of everyone. When asked anybody's relationship to Jessica, I would picture her in the center and everyone else in order around her and mentally \"swipe\" through them. After the reference picture, but before the 4 responses, I would mentally picture the reference person, and the people closest to them in whichever direction I as supposed to be going (more powerful or less powerful). For example, if asked about who was 3 below Hannah, I would picture Hannah, and then to the right of her, I would picture every person that was below her in power. I would never picture everyone at the same time."}
