{"rt": 382.98371291160583, "response": "I had a visual arrangement of the 9 people in my head, and it spanned from left (most powerful - Madison) to right (least powerful - Sarah). It was a horizontal diagram. I found it more helpful to remember the names in order of power as opposed to the faces, but eventually I did the task so many times that I found that my responses were automatic. My fingers would press the buttons for me even when I didn't reflect on my answer choice after seeing the 4 choices. I think this is because I am very familiar with the power rankings of the 9 people, and had my chosen answer in mind before the choices popped up. My brain was primed to search for the choice on screen that matched what I had in mind. I realized half way that the color of the shirt that the people were wearing, aside from their names, was the easiest thing to notice. For example, if my answer choice was Jessica, I would always look for the green shirt (it was a brighter green than Taylor's shirt)."}

{"rt": 128.3907368183136, "response": "I thought the task itself was not that hard especially because I have done it so many times. The only thing interfering with the task was the sounds of the fMRI scanners - they were so loud that they made me very anxious and I couldn't concentrate as well. I feel like that could be a possible confouding factor since it prevented me from doing as well on the task. However, it is a hard thing to change so I feel like the experiment was fine overall."}
