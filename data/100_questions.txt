{"rt": 189.97774410247803, "response": "The first two blocks were really difficult because I couldn't determine the pattern based on showing two people at once. However, using the trial and error during the first two blocks, I just crafted the order of people, assigned them all a number with the lowest ranking person being number 1 for math simplicity, and each time a face would come up I remembered them by their number, did the math, and then answered the problem. For example, Madison was ranked 5, and if you asked for the person ranked 3 beneath her, that would be rank 2 which corresponds toTaylor."}

Also the first half of the program was excessive and tiresome, which I felt made it more and more difficult as time went on, but only as a result of just not wanting to do it anymore."}
